# Automated Video Segmentation

### Objective

##### • The main objective of our project is to create an automatically applied 
lecture video segmentation system that splits lectures into bite-sized 
topics using audio and video features.
 • Prior works in this regard have considered the video frames and their 
output from an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system for 
segmentation.
 • The performance of our proposed system will be computed using 
metrics such as Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), Mean over 
Frames (MoF), F1-score, and Intersection over union (IoU).
